# Simple Bug Tracker - Back End
  
.NET 8.0  
Clean Architecture approach  
Minimal Apis  
Mediator pattern implemented using MediatR  
CQRS  
Entity Framework Core 8 (code first) with SQL Server database  
NUnit testing  

I chose not to implement the repository pattern. I have implemented the repository pattern in other open soure projects such as (https://github.com/ropeparison/rope-parison).  

CI/CD setup with github actions and azure web app service.  
SQL database hosted on azure db service. (Note, this is currently not running because it is not free...)  
  
Notes on setting up the database are included in the Infrastructure project ReadMe.
